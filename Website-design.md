# Website design
- I have added some simple and chaotic designs to ./design-ideas.
- if you want to add floating elements please use the placehold.co/
- don't use javascript as much as possible, if you use javascript please create custom components inside ./lib
- please make 3 different examples  using mix and matched styles from the ./design-ideas folder with 
	- example index.html, shop.html, and 1 character/example.html
and I will choose which one I like the best
## Task 1 - Home Page
- if you could redesign my website, I was thinking the home page would be simple like ./design-ideas/simple.jpg about me with a photo and a simple description
## Task 2 - Site Navigation
- have "shop" for "foofoo" which is my shop name @assets/logo.png 
which is the name of my digitial shop, home, kofi, etsy and itch
- you can make a web component for this so I can update the urls easily in one place.

## Task 3 - Shop
- there will be the character selector with all the characters linking to single character pages and the last option be all (which is #all products) and it links to the title below using css only smooth scroll
- the shop would list all the products under a title "All Products"
- the products would be listed using the product cards

## Task 4 - Character
- single character pages will be like profile pages, 1 big photo, like and dislikes, maybe address in the town, maybe house in the background 
- the profile photo should be of the character standing next to the mini character with a single color version of there house in the background.
- please check /assets for colors related to the characters.
- you can use https://placehold.co/ in the pages and include description in the comments of what images you think should go there.
- a section for products for that character
